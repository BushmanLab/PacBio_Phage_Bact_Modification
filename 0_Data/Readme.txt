Hi Eric,
Here is the file path for phage, positive and negative controls.

/media/THING1/alexandra/Pacbio_data_for_Eric

Raw data
File: Phage_088439_25cell_modification_csv  has IPD values for the phage DNA.
File: Bushman_Phage_88393_polished_assembly.fasta has the fasta sequences for the above IPD data

Positive and negative control data:
File: positive_control_T4_Phage_Glc-HMC-data-modifications.txt  has IPD values for the positive, control phage DNA.
File: negative_control_T4_Phage_WGA-data-modifications.txt  has IPD values for the negative (no DNA modifications), control phage DNA.
File: T4Phage_wt_Consensus_Final.fasta   This is the fasta sequence for both positive and negative IPD files. Note there is only one fasta sequence because it is the same DNA sequence for the positive and negative controls.
